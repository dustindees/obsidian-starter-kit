# Obsidian-Starter-Kit

I've been asked a lot over the years how my Obsidian setup works and how to emulate it. While I think the best system is the system personal to you, I think there is a lot to learn from others' systems, so I wanted to put together a more polished, sanitized version of my system with corresponding docs on why my system is the way it is. Feel free to steal and edit what works for you and ignore the rest.

This is still very early in development, so the documentation will be lacking, the functionality limited, and the bugs numerous. Proceed with caution!
